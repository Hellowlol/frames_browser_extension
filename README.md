# frames browser extension

This is nothing atm, but its intended to be a companion for plex and frames where you mark the most identifiable first frame and last frame of a intro of a show.

The idea is to crowdsource the collection of the intro/outro in a sentral db. This can later be used by a tool like bw_plex to skip the intro.
